Inspired from ThePrimeagen's [tmux_sessionizer](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/.dotfiles/blob/master/bin/.local/scripts/tmux-sessionizer) and adapted to suit my needs.

This script automates creating or attaching to a tmux session for a selected project directory. <br>
It allows the user to pick a directory, creates a tmux session, and opens relevant windows (e.g., for building) if applicable, further more, if a virtual enviroment exists, it sources it.<br>
It streamlines the process of managing multiple project environments in tmux.
